# Books

This CLI allows the user to search for books based on a keyword, returns a list of the titles of those books, and then allows the user to retrieve additional information about the title. 

## Installation

Install these gems to run this CLI:

gem install httparty 
gem install json 
gem install colorize 

## Usage

To initiate the CLI, enter 'ruby bin/books' into your terminal. There will be a greeting and then you will be asked to enter a keyword to search for. Enter your keyword and select a book to retrieve more information about it. Type 'books' to reinitialize the list, and 'exit' to exit the program.
